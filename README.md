Chisel is a tool for creating and managing characters for tabletop roleplaying games. The main focus is currently Pathfinder 2nd edition and D&D 5th edition, but more may be created in the future.

The only thing currently completed are some general HTML and CSS for the character builder and character sheet pages, and the next step is to set up the code for creating a character and populating the character sheet with the data, as well as the ability to save your created characters into JSON files.
There is an example JSON file for a Pathfinder character set up with some basics, but I'm sure that will change quite a bit as the actually JavaScript is created.

This is being made as a passion project with no current plans to monetize the content. It's just for fun!
