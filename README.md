# Chisel
Chisel ~is~ *will eventually be* a tool for creating and managing many things for tabletop roleplaying games. The main focus is currently Pathfinder 2nd edition and D&D 5th edition, but more may be created in the future.

The project is currently *very* bare bones, with some basic HTML and CSS ready to go. I'm currently working on the section of the tool I've dubbed *Quill* which is used by GMs to help write campaign settings.

This is being made as a passion project with no current plans to monetize the content. It's just for fun!

## Planned Features
- General Features
  - LAN Connection for GMs to access and interact with their players' sheets
  - Homebrew Creation Tool
- Features for Players
  - Character Creation
  - Automatically Updating Character Sheets
  - Access to Campaign files granted by the GM
- Features for GMs
  - World building tools for easily outlining a setting
  - Homebrew creating and sharing for players
 
## How To Use
The project runs on the `electron` package with some extra packages added on for convenience. After cloning the repo you'll need to run `npm install` to get the required packages, then run `npm start` to launch the program using electron.
